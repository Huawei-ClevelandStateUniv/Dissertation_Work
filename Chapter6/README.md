# Chapter 6

The code for chatper 6 is included in this folder.

* `Optimization_gait2dp_Paper_Lin_50HZ_New_Exp.py` is the main script for the foot placement controller identification.
* `Gait2dpiModel_Paper_Lin.py` contains the objective function, gradient of the objective, dynamic constraints, and the jacobian matrix of the walking simulation model in the direct collocation format.

## Walking data

This folder constains the the processing code of the experimental walking data. Processed data was saved on the Zenodo (DOI 10.5281/zenodo.3767611) (Chapter 6).

## Gait model

The model of gait2d was stored in the GitHub repository <https://github.com/csu-hmc/gait2dp_dGRF>. How to complie it with the python language in the Linux environment was described in the repository also.
