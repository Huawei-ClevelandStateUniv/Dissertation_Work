# Chapter 7

The code for chatper 7 is included in this folder.

## Foot placement controller

The foot placement controller was contained in the simulink model in the folder of `foot_placement_controller_in_Simulink`. Due to the privacy policy, the baseline control components of the exoskeleton were removed. The remaining part of the simlink model takes the hip and knee joint motions as inputs and generates the reference trajectory of the swing leg.

## Data processing code

The processing code of experimental data was included in the folder of `processing_code`.

In general, EMG data and joint motion data were analyzed and plotted.
